All the parts were designed with FDM 3D-Printing in mind, without requiring any printing supports.
The case has a snap fitting lid design that snaps into place without the need of any screws or adhesive.
The case currently supports two types of batteries, and a single IMU type at the moment.
(Support for different IMUs and extensions is in the works)
